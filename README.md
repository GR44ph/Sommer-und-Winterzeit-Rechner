I don't know how you've ended up here, considering you, for whatever reason, want to build and execute this project yourself though:
1. Consider not doing that, if you want to have a quick look at it you might as well run it on Repl.it for like 5 times until it actually works:
https://replit.com/@GR44ph/Sommer-und-Winterzeit-Rechner#Main.java
2. Consider that Main.java is the only file that is relevant to the procedure, the rest is github and/or repl.it trash that it, for some reason, decides to commit and push along with my actual project, trust me, I tried to put it on the .gitignore list, it didn't work, if this, for some reaon, gets really famous and potentially could make me rich I might consider putting the relevant file(s) (it's really just one) into a seperate folder.
